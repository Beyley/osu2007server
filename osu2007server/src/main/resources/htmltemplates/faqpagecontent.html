Ouendan is a rhythm game for the Nintendo DS. The gameplay consists of only three elements: tapping circles on the touchscreen, dragging a ball across a fixed path and rotating a spinner very fast. All these elements are timed to (covers of) popular Japanese songs. It looks like this on the DS:<br><br><img src="/web/globalfiles/ouendan.jpg" alt=""><br><br><br>You can see the circles on the bottom screen, and on the top screen you have the story. Each stage is basically a self-contained story about a person in trouble. That's where the Ouendan (Cheer squad) comes in. Through the magical power of male cheerleading, you have to help the people in trouble.<br><br><font color="#FF0040"><b>How do I play?!</b></font><br>While most PC users won't have a touchscreen at their disposal (unless you are a lucky one to own a tablet PC), this game is made to be playable with a normal mouse, as well as any number of input devices you can possible think of (wiimote works quite well, as does a graphics tablet if you have one of them laying around).  There are some songs which push the limits of the normal mouse, but all have been tested and are (somehow) passable using only a mouse.  Please don't let the lack of a touchscreen deter you!<br><br>Let's move on to the gameplay.<br><br><img src="/web/globalfiles/gp1.jpg" alt=""><br><br>^ Here you can see the circles you have to tap. The smaller coloured circle on the outside shrinks and you have to hit the note at the exact point the outside circle overlaps with the white border. Don't rely on your eyes, though: listening to the music to decide the right moment is better.<br><br><img src="/web/globalfiles/gp2.jpg" alt=""><br><br>^ Here we have a slider thrown into the mix. First, you have to hit it at the right moment, but it doesn't end there. A ball will start to move across the path you see. You have to hold the mousebutton and keep your pointer on the ball as it moves (you do not control the movement yourself). Sometimes, as in the screenshot above, you have to move back at the end of the path. You can tell by the reverse symbol at the end of the path.<br><br><img src="/web/globalfiles/gp3.jpg" alt=""><br><br>^ Same gameplay elements, so I'll use this to describe the interface. The top left bar is your "health". This will decrease at a steady rate, but you can replenish it by hitting notes at the right time. A perfectly timed hit will increase your health more than a badly timed hit. A total miss will take a good chunk out of your health. Next to the health bar is your score. The scoring system takes a while to figure out, but I won't bore you with the details here. The number on the bottom left is the combo counter/score multiplier.<br><br><img src="/web/globalfiles/gp4.jpg" alt=""><br><br>^ This is a spinner. You have to click on the inner yellow-red disc, hold the mouse, and spin like mad before the time runs out. The bars on the outside indicate how close you are to passing. On the DS, these are a good way to scratch your touchscreen (or screen protectors if you're smart), especially on the higher difficulties.  In osu!, spinners have been toned down as to not be such a nuisance to complete.  While holding a mouse button on a spinner, your <b>mouse is locked into the spin area</b>, so you can go crazy, or just spin very small circles - watch some of the top replays if you are interested in spinning styles!<br><br>Thanks to Eques for some of the text above, which I borrowed from his post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071122213806/http://www.stage48.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=616&amp;sid=68bfb06ceccc66706d130bbd09086d52" target="_blank">here</a>.

Open up the ffdshow video decoder configuration and make sure it is being used to decode the format in question (usually mpeg2, divx, xvid).  If you still encounter troubles, disable video support in options (or seek further help).<br><br><font color="#FF0040"><b>Graphical glitches!</b></font><br>Please report these kinda of bugs on the forum.  The game has only been tested on a limited number of systems so we will need to look at these problems on a case-to-case basis.<br><br><font color="#FF0040"><b>Its too hard!!!</b></font><br>Many people have been making beatmaps that are a challenge for themselves, but may be near-impossible or just frightening to beginners.

Future plans?</b></font><br>In short, a lot.  Time doesn't come easily, as I have a full-time programming position to uphold in business hours.  I've been working 18 hour days for several months to get osu! to the point it is at the moment, but don't have any plans on slowing down!  The requested feature list has some very cool stuff in store <!-- s;) --><img src="/web/globalfiles/icon_e_wink.gif" alt=";)" title="Wink"><!-- s;) -->.<br><br><font color="#FF0040"><b>Free forever?</b></font><br>Yes.  There are no plans for any charges nor commercial support (advertising and whatnot).  I will happily accept donations of good-will if you enjoy playing the game and can afford to spare some cash <!-- s:) --><img src="/web/globalfiles/icon_e_smile.gif" alt=":)" title="Smile"><!-- s:) -->.  Rest assured the money will go towards servers to host future ranking/game modes, or at very least keep my motivation in the positive. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20071122213806/https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_xclick&amp;business=pe%40ppy%2esh&amp;item_name=osu%21%20development%20fund&amp;buyer_credit_promo_code=&amp;buyer_credit_product_category=&amp;buyer_credit_shipping_method=&amp;buyer_credit_user_address_change=&amp;no_shipping=0&amp;no_note=1&amp;tax=0&amp;currency_code=AUD&amp;lc=AU&amp;bn=PP%2dDonationsBF&amp;charset=UTF%2d8" target="_blank">You can donate here</a> if you wish - thanks in advance.</span>
